## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These sections give you the broad, coherent foundation needed to understand Indian Philosophy as a whole. Study them **in this exact order**:

1. **I. Foundations: Orientation and Core Concepts**  
   Start here. This section introduces the basic vocabulary, historical context, and overall shape of the tradition.

2. **II. Shared Philosophical Frameworks (Cross-Cutting)**  
   Next, master the central ideas and methods (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, karma, liberation) that almost every Indian school uses and debates. This is the glue that holds the whole field together.

### Specialization Tracks

After finishing the Core (sections I and II), you reach the point where the roadmap branches. The remaining sections are **specialization tracks** that explore specific schools, periods, or comparative angles in much greater depth.

- **III. Classical Āstika (Orthodox) Systems**: Dive into the six major “orthodox” schools (Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta) that accept Vedic authority.
- **IV. Classical Nāstika (Heterodox) Systems**: Explore the major traditions that reject Vedic authority (mainly Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka materialism).
- **V. Later Developments and Comparative Perspectives**: Look at medieval debate traditions, modern Indian thinkers (19th–20th century), and conversations between Indian and Western philosophy.
