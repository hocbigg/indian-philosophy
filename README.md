# Summary

The Indian Philosophy curriculum is a **complete education in Indian Philosophy** using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: support learning through practical application throughout the curriculum.

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Practical work is integrated through the [Projects section](projects.md) and may be undertaken alongside coursework.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These sections give you the broad, coherent foundation needed to understand Indian Philosophy as a whole. Study them **in this exact order**:

1. **Foundations: Orientation and Core Concepts**  
   Start here. This section introduces the basic vocabulary, historical context, and overall shape of the tradition.

2. **Shared Philosophical Frameworks (Cross-Cutting)**  
   Next, master the central ideas and methods (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, karma, liberation) that almost every Indian school uses and debates. This is the glue that holds the whole field together.
