- [Classical Nāstika Heterodox Systems](#classical-n%C4%81stika-heterodox-systems)
- [Later Developments and Comparative Perspectives](#later-developments-and-comparative-perspectives)

After finishing the Core (sections I and II), you reach the point where the roadmap branches. The remaining sections are **specialization tracks** that explore specific schools, periods, or comparative angles in much greater depth.

- **Classical Āstika (Orthodox) Systems**: Dive into the six major “orthodox” schools (Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta) that accept Vedic authority.
- **Classical Nāstika (Heterodox) Systems**: Explore the major traditions that reject Vedic authority (mainly Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka materialism).
- **Later Developments and Comparative Perspectives**: Look at medieval debate traditions, modern Indian thinkers (19th–20th century), and conversations between Indian and Western philosophy.
